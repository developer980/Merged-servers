# Merged servers

### A basic setup for two servers that use the same controller system and the same data models.

Run "npm i" for each server in order to install the dependencies.
Run "node index.js" for each server to start.

I put some test routes which can be tested with API requests

The /login route can also be tested on the parameters "email" and "username" sent as raw data and will create a User model with them.

{
  "username":"example1",
  "email":"example2"
}
